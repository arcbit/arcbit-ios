"After a transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network, it may be included in a block that is published to the network. When that happens, it is said that the transaction has been mined at a depth of 1 block. With each subsequent block that is found, the number of blocks deep is increased by one. To be secure against double spending, a transaction should not be considered as confirmed until it is a certain number of blocks deep.\nA good rule of thumb is that 1 confirmation is good for small value amounts of bitcoins and a user should wait for more confirmations for larger value amounts.\nArcBit will display the confirmation number up until the 6th confirmation." = "在交易被广播到比特币网络之后，它可能被包含在发布到网络的块中。当这种情况发生时，意味着这笔交易已经被开采了1个区块的深度。随着后续区块的陆续开采，此块的深度逐步增加。为了防止双重支出，交易在达到一定的区块深度之前不应该被视为得到确认。\n一个较好的经验法则是，对于小额支付，1个确认深度是合适的；对于较大的金额，用户应该等待更多的确认深度。\nArcBit将显示确认深度直到达到6个。";

"Some people have compared bitcoin addresses to a bank routing number. It is a good analogy, however bitcoin addresses are public. So if you reuse the same bitcoin address for multiple payments like you would a routing number, people will be able to figure out how much bitcoin you have. Thus it is recommended that you only use one address per payment.\nThis causes usability issues making the user use a new address whenever receiving a payment is cumbersome.\nStealth/reusable addresses provides a better solution. When you give a sender a reusable address, the sender will derive a one time regular bitcoin address from the reusable address. Then the sender will send a payment to that regular bitcoin address. Now you can give many people just one reusable address and have them all send you payments without letting other people know how much bitcoin you have.\nA reusable address looks like this vJmxthatTBXibYe9aZavx18iAT9gyiJETGkhwPX2WbHQGuzX83YvQXynD2t8yHU4Xjfonu5x9m6B4yxquytFP1c2CRbVR9mecxesvE. A reusable address is a lot longer then a regular bitcoin address, it is 102 characters in length.\nReusable addresses are great, however there are no other mobile bitcoin wallets but ArcBit that supports reusable addresses for now. Which is why ArcBit supports receiving payments from both regular bitcoin addresses and reusable addresses.\nFor each account, you have one reusable address. You can find it on your Receive screen. Swipe all the way to right on the QRCode on your Receive screen and you will find a reusable address." = "有些人将比特币地址与银行路由号码进行了比较。这是一个很好的比喻。不过，比特币地址是公开的。因此，如果您重复使用相同的比特币地址进行多次付款（就像您的路由号码），则人们将能够计算出您拥有多少比特币。因此，建议您每个地址只收一次款。\n但是要求用户在每次收款时换用新地址是很麻烦的，这会导致可用性问题。\n隐形地址/可重用地址提供了更好的解决方案。当您给付款人一个可重用地址时，付款人将从可重用地址得到一个一次性的比特币地址。然后付款人会发送一个支付到该地址。现在您可以给许多人同一个可重用地址，让他们都给您付款，而不会让别人知道您有多少比特币。\n一个可重用地址看起来像这样：vJmxthatTBXibYe9aZavx18iAT9gyiJETGkhwPX2WbHQGuzX83YvQXynD2t8yHU4Xjfonu5x9m6B4yxquytFP1c2CRbVR9mecxesvE。可重用地址的长度为102个字符，比普通的比特币地址长得多。\n可重用地址非常棒，但是到目前为止，除了ArcBit，还没有其他比特币手机钱包支持。这就是为什么ArcBit支持从常规比特币地址和可重用地址接收付款的原因。\n对于每个账户，您都有一个可重用地址。在接收屏幕上一直向右滑动二维码，您就可以找到它。";
