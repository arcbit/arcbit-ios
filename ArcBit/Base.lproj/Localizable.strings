Since address reuse results in a loss of privacy for people using Bitcoin, ArcBit’s HD wallet account system will automatically handle the cycling of bitcoin addresses for you, so that you don’t use the same bitcoin address more then once.\nEach account also has a reusable address. You can find it in your receive screen. Swipe all the way to right on the QRCode in your receive screen and you will find a reusable address.\nYou can create an unlimited amount of accounts with ArcBit. See the help section on how to create a new account in ArcBit.";

"Some people has compared bitcoin addresses to a bank routing number. It is a good analogy, however bitcoin addresses are public. So if you reuse the same bitcoin address for multiple payments like you would a routing number, people will be able to figure out how much bitcoins you have. Thus it is recommended that you only use one address per payment.\nThis causes usability issues because making the user use a new address whenever receiving a payment is cumbersome.\nStealth/reusable addresses provides a better solution. When you give a sender a reusable address, the sender will derive a one time regular bitcoin address from the reusable address. Then the sender will send a payment to that regular bitcoin address. Now you can give many people just one reusable address and have them all send you payments without letting other people know how much bitcoins you have.\nA reusable address looks sometime like this vJmxthatTBXibYe9aZavx18iAT9gyiJETGkhwPX2WbHQGuzX83YvQXynD2t8yHU4Xjfonu5x9m6B4yxquytFP1c2CRbVR9mecxesvE. A reusable address is a lot longer then a regular bitcoin address, it is 102 characters in length.\nReusable addresses are great, however there are no other mobile bitcoin wallets but ArcBit that supports reusable addresses for now. Which is why ArcBit support receiving payments from both regular bitcoin addresses and reusable addresses.\nFor each account, you have one reusable address. You can find it in your receive screen.
